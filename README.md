# Profile Website
Hi, I'm Denio! I'm currently taking Web Programming course in BINUS University. For my first Laravel project, I'm making a professional profile website.
## Requirements
There are some technologies that are used in this websites:
1. Laravel (PHP Framework)
2. Bootstrap (CSS Framework)
3. HTML/CSS
4. Javascript
5. NPM (Node Package Manager)
6. Github & Git

And here's the instruction on how to run this website in you computer:
1. Make sure that you have installed laravel and npm. The installation guide for laravel can be found <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation">here</a>. While the installation guide for NPM can be found <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">here</a>.
2. Make sure that you have installed Git on your computer and have it connected to your GitHub
3. Find my project URL in this page by clicking Code > Copy. Or you could as well copy this link right away: https://github.com/DenioPranatha/SL1.git
4. Open your command prompt, and change your directory to the folder that you want by typing cd <your-directory>

6. Type ```cd SL1```to get in the project. We will install all the requirements now.

7. Type ```composer install``` for our further package manager
    ![tutor 4](https://github.com/DenioPranatha/SL1/blob/master/public/img/tutor4.png)
8. Type ```copy .env.example .env``` to copy the .env file. It is necessary because the Github file ignores .env from my real project so you habe to copy one with this command.

9. Type ```php artisan key:generate``` to generate random string for apps encription and decription. It's quite a difficult term but we dont need to understand it that deep.

10. Type ```npm install`` to install the Node Package Manager.
